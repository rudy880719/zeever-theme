Zeever
-------

Zeever is an opinionated Backdrop CMS theme designed specifically to 
support the [Digital Agency Recipe Package](https://backdropcms.org/project/digital_agency).
The Digital Agency Recipe Package is a bundle of functionality and sample
content to support a digital agency, artist, or consulting website.

While this theme is currently narrowly focused on the specific features in that recipe package,
in the future, we hope that Zeever will be usable on a broader variety of sites. 

**This theme is currently in Alpha Release stage, meaning that it is still undergoing
development and may change frequently.**

If you install an Alpha version of Zeever and then later upgrade it, you may 
experience changes that break your site. 

Work on this theme and the associated recipes/packages is being discussed in the
wiki for this project.
